/**
 * <p>Disables an organizational policy type in a root. A policy of a certain type can be
 *             attached to entities in a root only if that type is enabled in the root. After you
 *             perform this operation, you no longer can attach policies of the specified type to that
 *             root or to any organizational unit (OU) or account in that root. You can undo this by
 *             using the <a>EnablePolicyType</a> operation.</p>
 *          <p>This is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. If you disable
 *             a policy type for a root, it still appears enabled for the organization if <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html">all features</a> are enabled for the organization. Amazon Web Services recommends that you
 *             first use <a>ListRoots</a> to see the status of policy types for a specified
 *             root, and then use this operation.</p>
 *          <p>This operation can be called only from the organization's
 * management account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator.</p>
 *          <p> To view the status of available policy types in the organization, use <a>DescribeOrganization</a>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { OrganizationsClient, DisablePolicyTypeCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-organizations"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { OrganizationsClient, DisablePolicyTypeCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-organizations"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new OrganizationsClient(config);
 * const input = { // DisablePolicyTypeRequest
 *   RootId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   PolicyType: "SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY" || "RESOURCE_CONTROL_POLICY" || "TAG_POLICY" || "BACKUP_POLICY" || "AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY" || "CHATBOT_POLICY" || "DECLARATIVE_POLICY_EC2" || "SECURITYHUB_POLICY", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DisablePolicyTypeCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // DisablePolicyTypeResponse
 * //   Root: { // Root
 * //     Id: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     Arn: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     Name: "STRING_VALUE",
